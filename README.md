# Music Artist Search

## Description

* Createed an array of strings, each one related to a music artist topic.

* This app takes the music artist names in this array and create buttons for each name.

* A for loop appends a button for each string in the array.

* When the user clicks on a button, the page grabs 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and place them on the page.

* When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif animates. If the user clicks the gif again, it stops playing.

* Under every gif, its rating is displayed (PG, G, so on).

* This data is provided by the GIPHY API.

* A submit form is added to my page that takes a value from a user input box and adds it to my topics array. Then a function takes each topic in the array and remakes the buttons on the page.
